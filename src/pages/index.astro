  Welcome to my island See the palm trees wave in the wind Welcome to my island
  Hope you like me, you ain't leaving Welcome to my island See the palm trees
  wave in the wind Welcome to my island Hope you like me, you ain't leaving
  Desire, I wanna turn into you Desire, I wanna turn into you Float on the ocean
  blue Float on the ocean blue Welcome to my island See the palm trees wave in
  the wind Welcome to my island Hope you like me, you ain't leaving Desire, I
  wanna turn into you Desire, I wanna turn into you Float on the ocean blue
  Float on the ocean blue I am my father's daughter in the end He says, "Watch
  your ego, watch your head, girl You're so smart, so talented But now the
  water's turning red And it's all your fault, and it's all your mess And you're
  all alone, can't go to bed Too high on your adrenaline You gotta go somewhere
  where you can't pretend Go forget the rules, forget your friends Just you and
  your reflection 'Cause nothing's gonna be the same again No, nothing's gonna
  be the same again" Desire Float on the ocean blue Float on the ocean blue
